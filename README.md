# Social Media Blog API

## Background 

This project is a backend for a hypothetical social media app that manages usersâ€™ accounts as well as any messages that they submit to the application. The application functions as a micro-blogging or messaging app. Any user can see all of the messages posted to the site or any messages posted by a particular user. In either case, the backend delivers the data needed to display this information as well as process actions like logins, registrations, message creations, message updates, and message deletions.

## Database Tables 

This is contained in an sql script, and a ConnectionUtil class that will run the sql script.
